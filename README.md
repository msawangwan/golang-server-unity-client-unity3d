- **A (sad) attempt at creating a serialization protocol**

- **Server is written in golang**
- **see: [go-game-server repo](https://github.com/msawangwan/go-game-server)**

## Project State

- **A mess (aka work in progress)**
- **The only important script is the ClientTCP script, the rest is simply to test functionality**
